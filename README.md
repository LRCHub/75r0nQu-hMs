```lrc
[00:15.15] I remember when rock was young
[00:18.20] Me and Susie had so much fun
[00:21.52] Holding hands and skimming stones
[00:24.62] Had an old gold Chevy, and a place of my own
[00:46.62] 
[00:28.05] But the biggest kick I ever got
[00:30.82] Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
[00:34.26] While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
[00:37.41] We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock, well
[01:04.91] 
[00:41.39] Crocodile rocking is something shocking
[00:44.05] When your feet just can't keep still
[00:47.58] I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
[00:53.69] Oh, lawdy mama those Friday nights
[00:56.65] When Suzie wore her dresses tight
[01:00.44] And the Crocodile rocking was out of sight
[01:21.44] 
[01:06.84] Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
[01:12.44] La-la-la-la-laa
[01:15.44] La-la-la-la-laa
[01:22.94] 
[01:19.29] But the years went by and the rock just died
[01:22.54] Suzie went and left me for some foreign guy
[01:25.81] Long nights crying by the record machine
[01:29.07] Dreaming of my Chevy and old blue jeans
[01:48.57] 
[01:32.02] But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
[01:35.22] Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
[01:38.44] Learning fast as the weeks went past
[01:41.36] We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last, well
[02:07.86] 
[01:45.37] Crocodile rocking is something shocking
[01:48.19] When your feet just can't keep still
[01:51.78] I never knew me a better time and I guess, I never will
[01:57.92] Oh, lawdy mama those Friday nights
[02:00.92] When Suzie wore her dresses tight
[02:04.88] Crocodile rocking was out of sight
[02:21.88] 
[02:11.19] Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
[02:16.60] La-la-la-la-laa
[02:19.80] La-la-la-la-laa
[02:27.30] 
[02:23.67] I remember when rock was young
[02:26.44] Me and Suzie had so much fun
[02:29.86] Holding hands and skimming stones
[02:32.92] Had an old gold Chevy, and place of my own
[02:53.92] 
[02:36.35] But the biggest kick I ever got
[02:39.45] Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
[02:42.88] While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
[02:45.97] We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock, well
[03:13.47] 
[02:49.86] Crocodile rocking is something shocking
[02:52.47] When your feet just can't keep still
[02:56.06] I never knew me a better time and I guess, I never will
[03:02.32] Oh, lawdy mama those Friday nights
[03:05.31] When Suzie wore her dresses tight
[03:09.05] Crocodile rocking was out of sight
[03:26.05] 
[03:15.44] Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
[03:20.98] La-la-la-la-laa
[03:24.15] La-la-la-la-laa
[03:31.65] 
[03:28.29] Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
[03:33.62] La-la-la-la-laa
[03:36.98] La-la-la-la-laa
[03:44.48] 
[03:40.93] Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
[03:46.48] La-la-la-la-laa
[03:49.65] La-la-la-la-laa
